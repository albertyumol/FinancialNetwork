In this notebook, we build a correlation-based network (minimum spanning tree (MST)) of companies listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange. The entire process can be summarized into three steps:

- Set up the correlation matrix for the stock prices in the Philippine Stock Exchange.
- Convert the resulting correlation matrix into a distance matrix.
- Build a minimum spanning tree from the distance matrix.
